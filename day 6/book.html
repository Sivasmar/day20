<p>Summary
    Chapter 1 begins with an introduction to the oldest members of Charlie Bucket's family—and they are old. Then the reader meets Mr. and Mrs. Bucket, Charlie's parents, and finally Charlie himself: "He is pleased to meet you."
    
    Charlie and his family live in a two-room house "on the edge of a great town." It's a wretched existence. Charlie's grandparents occupy the family's one bed. His father's job screwing on toothpaste caps brings in less than half the money the family needs. They subsist on bread and margarine, potatoes, cabbage, and cabbage soup.
    
    This is hard for the whole family, but especially for Charlie, who is still growing. Charlie loves chocolate above all else, but he gets to taste it only on his birthday. It's torture—"the most terrible torturing thing you could imagine"—that the world's largest and most famous chocolate factory is within sight of Charlie's house. The chocolate from Wonka's Factory scents the air for half a mile around. On his way to and from school Charlie walks by the factory gates, inhaling the chocolate fumes and yearning to see what's inside the building.</p>

<p>Summary
    Every evening after supper Charlie goes into his grandparents' bedroom to chat before saying goodnight. The four old people and Charlie's parents look forward eagerly to these moments. For half an hour the family can be happy together.
    
    One evening Charlie asks about Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Is it really the biggest in the world, and is Mr. Willy Wonka really the cleverest chocolate maker? The question rouses the old people, especially 96-year-old Grandpa Joe. Excitedly he tells Charlie about the factory's wonderful candies. Mr. Wonka has a magical way with sweets. He can keep ice cream from melting in the hot sun and chewing gum from losing its taste. There's nothing he can't do with candy.
    
    Grandma Josephine asks Grandpa Joe to tell the story about Prince Pondicherry, which he does in the next chapter.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter 3 : Mr. Wonka and the Indian Prince">Chapter 3 : Mr. Wonka and the Indian Prince</h2>
<p>Grandpa joe recounts the story of Prince Pondicherry, who brings Mr. Wonka to India and hires him to build an entire chocolate palace. From the carpets to the ceilings, everything is made of chocolate; hot chocolate even comes out of the bathroom taps.

    When the palace is done, Mr. Wonka warns the Prince that it will start melting soon. "You'd better start eating it right away." Furious, the Prince says he'll keep the palace for ever—but it melts on the first hot day, and the Prince ends up swimming in a chocolate lake.
    
    Grandpa Joe lowers his voice to a whisper when he tells Charlie that no one is ever seen coming and going from the factory. The gates are always locked. Does anyone work there? If so, who?
    
    Charlie looks around to see if his grandparents are teasing him, but they're serious. He would love to know more, but it's bedtime. The story will have to wait until the following night.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Chapter 4 : The Secret Workers ">Chapter 4 : The Secret Workers </h2>
<p>The next evening Grandpa Joe explains why no one is ever seen going into or coming out of Mr. Wonka's factory. It seems Mr. Wonka employed thousands of people until spies penetrated the system and began stealing his most famous recipes. Mr. Wonka was so unhappy he fired all his workers, locked the gates, and closed down the factory.

    After months the factory showed signs of being in use again. Steam came out of the chimneys; the noise of the machines started up again; and the smell of melting chocolate filled the air. Mysterious shadows could be seen in the factory windows—shadows of people who seemed to be no more than knee-high.
    
    At this point in Grandpa Joe's story, Mr. Bucket rushes in from work. He's waving a newspaper with the huge headline WONKA FACTORY TO BE OPENED AT LAST TO LUCKY FEW.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Chapter 5 : The Golden Tickets ">Chapter 5 : The Golden Tickets </h2>
<p>Mr. Bucket excitedly reads the newspaper article aloud. Willy Wonka has decided to allow five children to visit his factory. He will give those five a tour of the factory and show them all its "secrets and magic." At the end of the tour all five winners will be given lifetime supplies of chocolate and candy.

    Golden Tickets have been placed in five random chocolate bars, which may be "in any shop in any street in any town in any country in the world," anywhere that Wonka's candies are sold.
    
    Grandpa Joe is elated. Wouldn't it be wonderful if Charlie found one of the tickets? Sadly, Charlie says there isn't a hope. But Grandma Georgina reminds him his birthday is next week. He'll get a chocolate bar then.</p>
